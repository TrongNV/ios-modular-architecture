# iOS Modular Architecture

This repo is an example of a modular iOS architecture. It shows how to use Cocoa Touch Framework as a separate app module and how to use CocoaPods for multiple targets from different frameworks.

The demo app uses CocoaPods and Carthage to link 3rd party dependencies. The repo has two already built libraries by Carthage so you do not have to run the Carthage command to install those libraries. However, it might be necessary to update them if you are running a different version of Swift. The app was created with Swift 4.1 and Xcode 9.4.

This project was created as a demonstration of the modular architecture for this article
